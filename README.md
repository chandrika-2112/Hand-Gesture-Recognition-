This project implements a gesture controller using the MediaPipe library in Python. It allows users to control their computer using hand gestures captured through a webcam.

## Features

- Detects hand gestures using the MediaPipe library.
- Recognizes various hand gestures such as fist, pinch, V-gesture, etc.
- Executes commands based on detected gestures, such as mouse movement, clicking, scrolling, etc.
- Supports multi-hand detection and gesture recognition.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI
- ctypes
- comtypes
- screen_brightness_control
- pycaw

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
